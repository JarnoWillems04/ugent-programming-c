From a blog that listed Gandhiis Top 10 Fundamentals for Changing the World.

1. Change
ìYou must be the change you want to see in the world.î
ìAs human beings, our greatness lies not so much in being able to remake the world ñ that is the myth of the atomic age ñ as in being able to remake ourselves.î
2. Control.
ìNobody can hurt me without my permission.î

3. Forgiveness
ìThe weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.î
ìAn eye for eye only ends up making the whole world blind.î

4. Action.
ìAn ounce of practice is worth more than tons of preaching.î

5. The present moment.
ìI do not want to foresee the future. caI am concerned with taking care of the present. God has given me no control over the moment following.î

6. Everyone is human.
ìI claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps.î
ìIt is unwise to be too sure of oneís own wisdom. It is healthy to be reminded that the strongest might weaken and the wisest might err.î

7. Persist.
ìFirst they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.î

8. Goodness.
ìI look only to the good qualities of men. Not being faultless myself, I wonít presume to probe into the faults of others.î
ìI suppose leadership at one time meant muscles; but today it means getting along with people.î

9. Truth
ìHappiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.î
ìAlways aim at complete harmony of thought and word and deed. Always aim at purifying your thoughts and everything will be well.î

10. Development.
ìConstant development is the law of life, and a man who always tries to maintain his dogmas in order to appear consistent drives himself into a false position.î
